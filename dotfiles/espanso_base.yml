# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.

# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espanso/espanso/dev/schemas/match.schema.json

matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"

  - trigger: "]na"
    replace: "Raghav Mallampalli"

  - trigger: "]nu"
    replace: "9597869226"

  - trigger: "]sm"
    replace: "mm18b109@smail.iitm.ac.in"

  - trigger: "]mg"
    replace: "raghavmallampalli1234@gmail.com"

  - trigger: "]ms"
    replace: "raghav@synthefy.com"

  # Addresses
  # These AHK hotstrings require an ending character (like space or enter).
  # This is also Espanso's default behavior.
  - trigger: "]ad1"
    replace: "New number 1, old 251, 43rd street, 8th sector, K.K. Nagar, Chennai, 600078"

  # Date and Time
  - trigger: "]d"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          # %Y = year, %m = month, %d = day, %I = 12h hour, %M = minute, %p = AM/PM
          format: "%Y/%m/%d %I:%M %p"


  # German characters
  # The '?' in AHK (:*?:) allows the trigger to fire even when it's inside another word.
  # In Espanso, this is enabled with the 'trigger_in_word' option.
  - trigger: "]a]"
    replace: "ä"
    trigger_in_word: true

  - trigger: "]o]"
    replace: "ö"
    trigger_in_word: true

  - trigger: "]u]"
    replace: "ü"
    trigger_in_word: true

  - trigger: "]s]"
    replace: "ß"
    trigger_in_word: true
